Welcome to GHER GitHub!

## What's the GHER?
GHER stands for _GeoHydrodynamics and Environment Research_. It is a research group of the [University of Liège](https://www.uliege.be). 
It is also part of the Freshwater and OCeanic science Unit of reSearch ([FOCUS](https://www.focus.uliege.be)).

## What do we do?
Our work is mainly focused on marine and environmental study and modelling.

We develop software tools for the spatial interpolation of in situ measurements and satellite images, based on variational methods and more recently on neural network.

We also organise the _International Liège Colloquium on Ocean Dynamics_ (aka _The Colloquium_) since 1968.
